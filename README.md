# Hi, Welcome To CoLab  ðŸ¤™

## We Are A Data Parsing and Aggregation Platform:
- Import and export data without barriers:
  All read and writes operate on a spreadsheet you control using the Google Sheets API 
- No waiting for the database guy:
  Database Management Systems are great for technical experts, but can unfortunately slow down teams by blocking access to their data layer. For teams that desire fast iteration, there is CoLab. Our software is the bridge between stable software and tangible data. By harnessing the power of Google Cloud Platform, no team will have to wait for a database guy.
- Keep everyone in the loop:
  Seamlessly request manager approval on lab reports using CoLab Approverâ„¢ email notifications.
  
- Syncing Without Sinking:
  CoLab rides the wave of real-time collaboration using Socket.io. Edit with your team without worrying about sinking ships or sinking deadlines, completing your titanic missions without Titanic results.
  
- Power in Number:
  As engineers, we know great results are built on a foundation of great data. Our dataset parsing and graphing technology can take a spreadsheet and turn it into beautiful visualizations without wasting time formatting.
